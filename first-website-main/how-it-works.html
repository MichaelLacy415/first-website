        <h2>Hydrogen Fuel Cells</h2>

        <p>
            Hydrogen fuel cells are devices that convert the chemical energy of hydrogen into electricity. They work by
            combining hydrogen and oxygen to produce water, heat, and electricity. The process is similar to a battery,
            but
            instead of running down and needing to be recharged, fuel cells can produce electricity as long as fuel is
            supplied1.
        </p>

        <p>
            A fuel cell consists of two electrodes, an anode and a cathode, separated by an electrolyte. Hydrogen is fed
            to
            the anode, where a catalyst separates the hydrogen molecules into protons and electrons. The electrons flow
            through an external circuit, creating an electric current. The protons migrate through the electrolyte to
            the
            cathode, where they combine with oxygen and the electrons to produce water and heat2.

        <p>
            There are several types of fuel cells, each with its own electrolyte and operating characteristics. For
            example,
            polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells use a proton-conducting polymer membrane as the electrolyte
            and
            operate at relatively low temperatures. They are well-suited for use in vehicles and other applications
            where
            quick changes in power output are required2.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hydrogen can be produced from a variety of domestic resources, including natural gas, nuclear power,
            biomass,
            and renewable power sources such as solar and wind. This makes it an attractive fuel option for
            transportation
            and electricity generation applications1.
        </p>

        <p>
            In summary, hydrogen fuel cells work by combining hydrogen and oxygen to produce water, heat, and
            electricity.
            They offer a clean and efficient way to generate power from a variety of domestic resources.

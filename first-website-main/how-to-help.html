        <p>
            Hydrogen fuel cells are a promising technology that can help reduce carbon emissions and provide clean
            energy. Here are some ways that people can help make a change with hydrogen fuel cells:
        </p>

        <div>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Support renewable energy:</span> Hydrogen can be produced from renewable energy sources such
                    as solar,
                    wind, and nuclear power. By supporting the development and use of these clean energy sources, you
                    can help reduce the carbon emissions associated with producing hydrogen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Advocate for hydrogen infrastructure:</span> The development of hydrogen infrastructure, such
                    as refueling
                    stations and pipelines, is essential for the widespread adoption of hydrogen fuel cell technology.
                    You can help by advocating for government policies and funding to support the development of this
                    infrastructure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Support research and development:</span> Continued research and development is needed to
                    improve the
                    efficiency and performance of hydrogen fuel cells. You can help by supporting organizations and
                    institutions that are working on advancing this technology.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Choose hydrogen-powered vehicles:</span> If you are in the market for a new vehicle, consider
                    choosing one
                    that is powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. This will help reduce your carbon footprint and
                    support the
                    growth of the hydrogen fuel cell industry.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Educate others:</span> Help spread awareness about the potential benefits of hydrogen fuel
                    cells by
                    educating others about this technology. Share information with your friends, family, and community
                    about how hydrogen fuel cells work and how they can help reduce carbon emissions.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p>
            By taking these actions, you can help support the growth of the hydrogen fuel cell industry and contribute
            to a cleaner, more sustainable future.
